# WebSockets

A basic (incomplete) implementation of the WebSocket protocol in python. I started this project to better understand how the WebSocket protocol works and to gain experience in implementing a binary protocol as described in an RFC.

Please note that this is not intended to be a functioning WebSocket library but rather a basic implementation for learning purposes. Notably, it is not a full implementation of the spec and uses static values in places that the RFC specifies should be random.
